Timer Task Manager Application with CRUD Operations
This Timer Task Manager is a versatile application built with React, designed to manage tasks and employee productivity through real-time tracking and seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Using React props to pass data between components, the app provides a responsive and dynamic experience for managing employees and their assigned tasks.

Key Features:
Employee Management with Task Assignment: Register employees, assign tasks with specific start and end times, and easily manage task assignments. The employee list shows the current task status for each employee, keeping the team organized and tasks on track.

Real-Time Task Status Updates: As tasks begin, status updates automatically to "In Progress." Employees can mark tasks as "Completed" by clicking the button before the timer expires. If the task time runs out, the status updates to "Failed," while unstarted tasks remain marked as "To-Do."

Comprehensive CRUD Operations: Easily manage your employee and task data with full CRUD capabilities:

Create new employees and assign tasks
Read and view all employees and their assigned tasks
Update tasks or employee details as needed
Delete tasks or employee records for streamlined data management
This project is an ideal solution for small teams looking to manage tasks, track time, and optimize productivity. Its user-friendly interface makes task tracking simple and effective, while CRUD operations provide full control over task and employee management.
