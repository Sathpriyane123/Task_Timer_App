This Timer Task Manager is a dynamic application built with React, designed to streamline task management with real-time status tracking for employees. The app leverages React props to pass data efficiently between components, creating a smooth and responsive user experience.

Key Features:

Employee Registration & Task Assignment: Easily register new employees and assign tasks with specific start and end times. Each employee is listed with their assigned tasks and current task status, ensuring clear and organized task management.

Real-Time Task Status Updates: Task status updates in real time! When a task's timer starts, the status updates to "In Progress." If the employee completes the task by clicking the "Complete" button before the timer ends, the status changes to "Completed." If time runs out before completion, the status is marked as "Failed." For unstarted tasks, the status remains as "To-Do."

This project offers a clear, organized view of tasks and employee productivity, ideal for managing workflows in small teams. Itâ€™s simple, efficient, and a perfect React-based solution for task and time management.
